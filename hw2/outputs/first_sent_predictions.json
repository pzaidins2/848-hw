[SEP] wilhelm ostwald friedrich wilhelm ostwald (, ; 2 september 1853 \u2013 4 april 1932 ) was a german chemist. he received the nobel prize in chemistry in 1909 for his work on catalysis, chemical equilibria and reaction velocities. ostwald, jacobus henricus van't hoff, and svante arrhenius are usually credited with being the modern founders of the field of physical chemistry. ostwald was born ethnically baltic german in riga, to master - cooper gottfried wilhelm ostwald ( 1824 \u2013 1903 ) and elisabeth leuckel ( 1824 \u2013 1903 ). he was the middle child of three, born after eugen ( 1851 \u2013 1932 ) and before gottfried ( 1855 \u2013 1918 ). ostwald graduated from the university of tartu, estonia, ( then dorpat ) in 1875, received his ph. d. there in 1878 under the guidance of carl schmidt, and taught at co - arc from 1875 to 1881 and at riga polytechnicum from 1881 to 1887. ostwald is usually credited with inventing the ostwald process ( patent 1902 ), used in the manufacture of nitric acid, although the basic chemistry had been patented some 64 years earlier by kuhlmann, when it was probably of only academic interest due to the lack of a significant source of ammonia. that may have still been the state of affairs in 1902, although things were due to change dramatically in the second half of the decade as a result of haber and bosch's work on their nitrogen fixing process ( completed by 1911 or 1913 ). the date 1908 ( six years after the patent ) is often given for the invention of the ostwald process, and it may be that these developments motivated him to do additional work to commercialize the process in that time - frame. alternatively, six years might simply have been the bureaucratic interval between filing the patent and the time it was granted. the combination of these two breakthroughs soon led to more economical and larger - scale production of fertilizers and explosives, of which germany was to find itself in desperate need during world war i. ostwald also did significant work on dilution theory leading to his discovery of the law of dil",

[SEP] igor stravinsky igor fyodorovich stravinsky ( sometimes spelled \" strawinski \", \" strawinsky \", or \" stravinskii \" ; ; 6 april 1971 ) was a russian - born composer, pianist, and conductor. he is widely considered one of the most important and influential composers of the 20th century. stravinsky's compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity. he first achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the impresario sergei diaghilev and first performed in paris by diaghilev's ballets russes : \" the firebird \" ( 1910 ), \" petrushka \" ( 1911 ) and \" the rite of spring \" ( 1913 ). the last of these transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure and was largely responsible for stravinsky's enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design. his \" russian phase \" which continued with works such as \" renard \", \" the soldier's tale \" and \" les noces \", was followed in the 1920s by a period in which he turned to neoclassical music. the works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms ( concerto grosso, fugue and symphony ), drawing on earlier styles, especially from the 18th century. in the 1950s, stravinsky adopted serial procedures. his compositions of this period shared traits with examples of his earlier output : rhythmic energy, the construction of extended melodic ideas out of a few two - or three - note cells and clarity of form, and of instrumentation. stravinsky was born on 17 june 1882 in oranienbaum, a suburb of saint petersburg, the russian imperial capital, and was brought up in saint petersburg. his parents were both from ukraine : fyodor stravinsky, a bass singer at the kiev opera house 1873 \u2013 76, and at the mariinsky theatre in st.",

[SEP] friedrich nietzsche friedrich wilhelm nietzsche ( or ; ; 15 october 1844 \u2013 25 august 1900 ) was a german philosopher, cultural critic, poet, philologist, and latin and greek scholar whose work has exerted a profound influence on western philosophy and modern intellectual history. he began his career as a classical philologist before turning to philosophy. he became the youngest ever to hold the chair of classical philology at the university of basel in 1869, at the age of 24. nietzsche resigned in 1879 due to health problems that plagued him most of his life, and he completed much of his core writing in the following decade. in 1889, at age 44, he suffered a collapse and a complete loss of his mental faculties. he lived his remaining years in the care of his mother ( until her death in 1897 ), and then with his sister elisabeth forster - nietzsche, and died in 1900. nietzsche's body of work touched widely on art, philology, history, religion, tragedy, culture, and science, and drew early inspiration from figures such as schopenhauer, wagner, and goethe. his writing spans philosophical polemics, poetry, cultural criticism, and fiction while displaying a fondness for aphorism and irony. some prominent elements of his philosophy include his radical critique of truth in favor of perspectivism ; his genealogical critique of religion and christian morality, and his related theory of master \u2013 slave morality ; his aesthetic affirmation of existence in response to the \" death of god \" and the profound crisis of nihilism ; his notion of the apollonian and dionysian ; and his characterization of the human subject as the expression of competing wills, collectively understood as the will to power. in his later work, he developed influential concepts such as the \" \" and the doctrine of eternal return, and became increasingly preoccupied with the creative powers of the individual to overcome social, cultural, and moral contexts in pursuit of new values and aesthetic health. after his death, elisabeth forster - nietzsche became the curator and editor of her brother's manuscripts, reworking nietzsche's unpublished writings to fit her own german nationalist ideology while often contradicting or obfuscating his stated opinions, which were explicitly opposed to antisemitism and",
