[SEP] pangaea pangaea or pangea ( ) was a supercontinent that existed during the late paleozoic and early mesozoic eras. it assembled from earlier continental units approximately 335 million years ago, and it began to break apart about 175 million years ago. in contrast to the present earth and its distribution of continental mass, much of pangaea was in the southern hemisphere and surrounded by a superocean, panthalassa. pangaea was the most recent supercontinent to have existed and the first to be reconstructed by geologists. the name \" pangaea / pangea \" is derived from ancient greek \" pan \" (, \" all, entire, whole \" ) and \" gaia \" (, \" mother earth, land \" ). the concept that the continents once formed a continuous land mass was first proposed by alfred wegener, the originator of the theory of continental drift, in his 1912 publication \" the origin of continents \" ( \" die entstehung der kontinente \" ). he expanded upon his hypothesis in his 1915 book \" the origin of continents and oceans \" ( \" die entstehung der kontinente und ozeane \" ), in which he postulated that, before breaking up and drifting to their present locations, all the continents had formed a single supercontinent that he called the \" \" urkontinent \" \". the name \" pangea \" occurs in the 1920 edition of \" die entstehung der kontinente und ozeane \", but only once, when wegener refers to the ancient supercontinent as \" the pangaea of the carboniferous \". wegener used the germanized form \" pangaa \", but the name entered german and english scientific literature ( in 1922 and 1926, respectively ) in the latinized form \" pangaea \" ( of the greek \" pangaia \" ), especially due to a symposium of the american association of petroleum geologists in november 1926. < ref name = \" waterschoot / gracht \" > willem a. j. m. van waterschoot van der gracht ( and 13 other authors ) : \" theory of continental drift : a symposium of the origin and movements of land - masses of both inter - continental and intra -",

[SEP] aspirated consonant in phonetics, aspiration is the strong burst of breath that accompanies either the release or, in the case of preaspiration, the closure of some obstruents. in english, aspirated consonants are allophones in complementary distribution with their unaspirated counterparts, but in some other languages, notably most indian and east asian languages, the difference is contrastive, while in arabic and persian, all stops are aspirated. to feel or see the difference between aspirated and unaspirated sounds, one can put a hand or a lit candle in front of one's mouth, and say \" spin \" and then \" pin \". one should either feel a puff of air or see a flicker of the candle flame with \" pin \" that one does not get with \" spin \". in the international phonetic alphabet ( ipa ), aspirated consonants are written using the symbols for voiceless consonants followed by the aspiration modifier letter, a superscript form of the symbol for the voiceless glottal fricative. for instance, represents the voiceless bilabial stop, and represents the aspirated bilabial stop. voiced consonants are seldom actually aspirated. symbols for voiced consonants followed by, such as, typically represent consonants with murmured voiced release ( see below ). in the grammatical tradition of sanskrit, aspirated consonants are called voiceless aspirated, and breathy - voiced consonants are called voiced aspirated. there are no dedicated ipa symbols for degrees of aspiration and typically only two degrees are marked : unaspirated and aspirated. an old symbol for light aspiration was, but this is now obsolete. the aspiration modifier letter may be doubled to indicate especially strong or long aspiration. hence, the two degrees of aspiration in korean stops are sometimes transcribed or and, but they are usually transcribed and, with the details of voice - onset time given numerically. preaspirated consonants are marked by placing the aspiration modifier letter before the consonant symbol : represents the preaspirated bilabial stop. unaspirated or tenuis consonants are occasionally marked with the modifier letter for unaspiration, a superscript equals",

[SEP] gustav mahler gustav mahler ( ; 7 july 1860, kaliste in bohemia, now czech republic \u2013 18 may 1911, vienna in austria - hungary ) was an austrian late - romantic composer, and one of the leading conductors of his generation. as a composer he acted as a bridge between the 19th century austro - german tradition and the modernism of the early 20th century. while in his lifetime his status as a conductor was established beyond question, his own music gained wide popularity only after periods of relative neglect which included a ban on its performance in much of europe during the nazi era. after 1945 his compositions were rediscovered and championed by a new generation of listeners ; mahler then became one of the most frequently performed and recorded of all composers, a position he has sustained into the 21st century. born in bohemia ( then part of austrian empire ) as a german - speaking jew of humble circumstances, mahler displayed his musical gifts at an early age. after graduating from the vienna conservatory in 1878, he held a succession of conducting posts of rising importance in the opera houses of europe, culminating in his appointment in 1897 as director of the vienna court opera ( hofoper ). during his ten years in vienna, mahler \u2014 who had converted to catholicism to secure the post \u2014 experienced regular opposition and hostility from the anti - semitic press. nevertheless, his innovative productions and insistence on the highest performance standards ensured his reputation as one of the greatest of opera conductors, particularly as an interpreter of the stage works of wagner, mozart, and tchaikovsky. late in his life he was briefly director of new york's metropolitan opera and the new york philharmonic. mahler's \" \u0153uvre \" is relatively limited ; for much of his life composing was necessarily a part - time activity while he earned his living as a conductor. aside from early works such as a movement from a piano quartet composed when he was a student in vienna, mahler's works are generally designed for large orchestral forces, symphonic choruses and operatic soloists. these works were frequently controversial when first performed, and several were slow to receive critical and popular approval ; exceptions included his symphony no.",

[SEP] na + / k + - atpase - atpase ( sodium - potassium adenosine triphosphatase, also known as the pump or sodium - potassium pump ) is an enzyme ( ) ( an electrogenic transmembrane atpase ) found in the plasma membrane of all animal cells. the - atpase enzyme is a solute pump that pumps sodium out of cells while pumping potassium into cells, both against their concentration gradients. this pumping is active ( i. e. it uses energy from atp ) and is important for cell physiology. an example application is nerve conduction. it has antiporter - like activity, but since it moves both molecules against their concentration gradients it is not a true antiporter, which would require one solute to move with its gradient, not against it. active transport is responsible for the fact that cells contain a relatively high concentration of potassium ions but low concentrations of sodium ions. the mechanism responsible for this is the sodium - potassium pump, which moves these two ions in opposite directions across the plasma membrane. this was investigated by following the passage of radioactively labeled ions across the plasma membrane of certain cells. it was found that the concentrations of sodium and potassium ions on the two sides of the membrane are interdependent, suggesting that the same carrier transports both ions. it is now known that the carrier is an atp - ase and that it pumps three sodium ions out of the cell for every two potassium ions pumped in. the sodium - potassium pump was discovered in the 1950s by a danish scientist, jens christian skou, who was awarded a nobel prize in 1997. it marked an important step forward in the understanding of how ions get into and out of cells, and it has a particular significance for excitable cells such as nervous cells, which depend on this pump for responding to stimuli and transmitting impulses. the - atp",

[SEP] oboe oboes are a family of double reed woodwind musical instruments. the most common oboe plays in the treble or soprano range. oboes are usually made of wood, but there are also oboes made of synthetic materials. a soprano oboe measures roughly long, with metal keys, a conical bore and a flared bell. sound is produced by blowing into the reed and vibrating a column of air. the distinctive oboe tone is versatile, and has been described as \" bright \". when the term \" oboe \" is used alone, it is generally taken to mean the standard treble instrument rather than other instruments of the family, such as the \" cor anglais \" ( english horn ) or the oboe \" d'amore \". in english, prior to 1770, the standard instrument was called a \" hautbois \", \" hoboy \", or \" french hoboy \" ( pronounced, borrowed from the french name, a compound word made of \" haut \" [ \" high \", \" loud \" ] and \" bois \" [ \" wood \", \" woodwind \" ] ). the spelling of \" oboe \" was adopted into english c. 1770 from the italian \" oboe \", a transliteration in that language's orthography of the 17th - century pronunciation of the french name. a musician who plays the oboe is called an \" oboist \" or simply an \" oboe player \". today, the oboe is commonly used in concert bands, orchestras, chamber music, film music, in some genres of folk music, and as a solo instrument, and is occasionally heard in jazz, rock music, pop music, and popular music. in comparison to other modern woodwind instruments, the treble oboe is sometimes referred to as having a clear and penetrating voice. \" the sprightly companion \", an instruction book published by henry playford in 1695, describes the oboe as \" majestical and stately, and not much inferior to the trumpet. \" humorously, the sound of the oboe is described in the play \" angels in america \" as like \" that of a duck if the duck were a song",

[SEP] john donne john donne ( ) ( 22 january 1573 \u2013 31 march 1631 ) was an english poet and cleric in the church of england. he is considered the pre - eminent representative of the metaphysical poets. his works are noted for their strong, sensual style and include sonnets, love poems, religious poems, latin translations, epigrams, elegies, songs, satires and sermons. his poetry is noted for its vibrancy of language and inventiveness of metaphor, especially compared to that of his contemporaries. donne's style is characterised by abrupt openings and various paradoxes, ironies and dislocations. these features, along with his frequent dramatic or everyday speech rhythms, his tense syntax and his tough eloquence, were both a reaction against the smoothness of conventional elizabethan poetry and an adaptation into english of european baroque and mannerist techniques. his early career was marked by poetry that bore immense knowledge of english society and he met that knowledge with sharp criticism. another important theme in donne's poetry is the idea of true religion, something that he spent much time considering and about which he often theorized. he wrote secular poems as well as erotic and love poems. he is particularly famous for his mastery of metaphysical conceits. despite his great education and poetic talents, donne lived in poverty for several years, relying heavily on wealthy friends. he spent much of the money he inherited during and after his education on womanising, literature, pastimes, and travel. in 1601, donne secretly married anne more, with whom he had twelve children. in 1615, he became an anglican priest, although he did not want to take anglican orders. he did so because king james i persistently ordered it. in 1621, he was appointed the dean of st paul's cathedral in",

        "answer": "urea urea, also known as carbamide, is an organic compound with the chemical formula co ( nh ). this amide has two \u2013 nh groups joined by a carbonyl ( c = o ) functional group. urea serves an important role in the metabolism of nitrogen - containing compounds by animals and is the main nitrogen - containing substance in the urine of mammals. it is a colorless, odorless solid, highly soluble in water, and practically non - toxic ( is 15 g / kg for rats ). dissolved in water, it is neither acidic nor alkaline. the body uses it in many processes, most notably nitrogen excretion. the liver forms it by combining two ammonia molecules ( nh ) with a carbon dioxide ( co ) molecule in the urea cycle. urea is widely used in fertilizers as a source of nitrogen and is an important raw material for the chemical industry. friedrich wohler's discovery in 1828 that urea can be produced from inorganic starting materials was an important conceptual milestone in chemistry. it showed for the first time that a substance previously known only as a byproduct of life could be synthesized in the laboratory without biological starting materials, contradicting the widely held doctrine of vitalism. more than 90 % of world industrial production of urea is destined for use as a nitrogen - release fertilizer. urea has the highest nitrogen content of all solid nitrogenous fertilizers in common use. therefore, it has the lowest transportation costs per unit of nitrogen nutrient. the standard crop - nutrient rating ( npk rating ) of urea is 46 - 0 - 0. many soil bacteria possess the enzyme urease, which catalyzes conversion of urea to ammonia ( nh ) or ammonium ion ( nh ) and bicarbonate ion ( hco ). thus urea fertilizers rapidly transform to the ammonium form in soils. among the soil bacteria known to carry urease, some ammonia - oxidizing bacteria ( aob ), such as species of nitrosomonas, can also assimilate the carbon dioxide the reaction releases to make biomass via the calvin cycle, and harvest energy by oxidizing ammonia ( the other product of urease ) to nitrite, a process termed nitrification. nitrite - oxidizing bacteria, especially nitro",

        "answer": "dopamine pathways, one of which plays a major role in reward - motivated behavior. most types of rewards increase the level of dopamine in the brain, and many addictive drugs increase dopamine neuronal activity. other brain dopamine pathways are involved in motor control and in controlling the release of various hormones. these pathways and cell groups form a dopamine system which is neuromodulatory. outside the central nervous system, dopamine functions primarily as a local chemical messenger. in blood vessels, it inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator ( at normal concentrations ) ; in the kidneys, it increases sodium excretion and urine output ; in the pancreas, it reduces insulin production ; in the digestive system, it reduces gastrointestinal motility and protects intestinal mucosa ; and in the immune system, it reduces the activity of lymphocytes. with the exception of the blood vessels, dopamine in each of these peripheral systems is synthesized locally and exerts its effects near the cells that release it. several important diseases of the nervous system are associated with dysfunctions of the dopamine system, and some of the key medications used to treat them work by altering the effects of dopamine. parkinson's disease, a degenerative condition causing tremor and motor impairment, is caused by a loss of dopamine - secreting neurons in an area of the midbrain called the substantia ni",
